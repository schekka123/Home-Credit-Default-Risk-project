Project aims to improve loan approval process by considering factors such as monthly income, existing loans, and repayment history. 

During Phase 0, explored the datasets and In Phase 1, exploratory data analysis was conducted on datasets, established a pipeline using the most correlated features, and created a baseline Logistic Regression Model with a test accuracy of 92 percent and a train accuracy of 91.7 percent.

In Phase 2, continued with feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, feature selection, and analysis of feature importance. Tested several models, including Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and K-Nearest Neighbors, and found that the Random Forest model provided the best accuracies. The model had a test accuracy of 68 percent, an AUC score of 97 percent, and an error rate of 2.6407. The Kaggle score was 0.72559, and the private score was 0.72778.

In phase 3, Feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, and testing of various models including MLP and XGBoost resulted in an ROC accuracy of 0.72 and AUC accuracy of 0.75. Kaggle score of 0.73 was achieved with XGBoost.
